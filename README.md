# what is the rule ?
1. Moves are allowed only on the black squares.
2. pieces only move diagonally forward toward the opponent .
3. When the chess piece moves to the bottom of the opponent's board, it becomes the king.
4. as you’ll see，kings can also move backwards.
5. A piece may only move one square unless it is making a jump.
# how to play ?
Black moves first. Players take turns moving one checker per turn. A piece can move one space sideways,forward, or diagonally towards the opposing home space. It CANNOT move backwards towards it own home space. (Kings can, as you’ll see.)

# WINNING !
A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move. Usually, this is because all of the opponent’s pieces have been captured, but sometimes it is because the opponent has no space to move onto (he is “blocked” from moving).
